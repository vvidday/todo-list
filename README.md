# todo-list

Todo List Project from The Odin Project (Javascript Path)

Things I learnt from this project:

- Tried to apply OOP principles (Single Responsibility Principle) - Each object should only have one responsibility.
- Basic CSS transitions (opening/collapsing div and navbar)
- Combining regular HTML with dynamically generating HTML with JS
- Arrays in JS are compared (`==`) by memory addresses, so `[1,2,3] == [1,2,3]` returns `false`, which is unlike python. Got stumped by this for a while.
- Storing objects in `localStorage` results in the objects losing some data (in this case, I could no longer use the objects' functions after retrieving them). Instead, the approach is to store the _data_ of our objects in `localStorage`, and upon retrieval, use the data to instantiate new objects to use.
- Overall getting more comfortable with CSS styling and JS.
